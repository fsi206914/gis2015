* Questions

  1. In the test data, it is not specified if it is northern
       hemisphere or south, since Easting/Northing representation may
       represent two different points on earth.  Can we assume the
       coordinates are all in northern hemisphere?
  2. What's more, if some of the coordinates are in the north, and
       some in the south, it's not clear how to calculate the distance
       since Easting/Northing have different reference system, 0 -
       9,300,000 in the northern hemisphere and 1,100,000 - 10,000,000
       in the south.
  3. Is the easting coordinates (X value) right?  I think the easting
       coordinates ranges from 160,000 to 834,000 at the equator, and
       465,000 and 515,000 at 84N.  But the points have over 1,005,000
       for X value.
